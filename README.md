# MatrixVectorLib
This is a collection of files for a beginner project i am trying to develop

The worst attempt of making a Matrix and Vector library that you've ever seen. For learning purposes

If you are interested in breaking things, you can go ahead and test the functions in the various classes

You can take a look at the main.cpp file for a walk-through on what you can do with this library
